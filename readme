# Codewars Solidity Practice

This repo contains a collection of Solidity smart contracts and corresponding JavaScript tests, designed as practical coding exercises to level up your smart contract development skills. Inspired by the "Codewars" philosophy: learn through hands-on, incremental challenges.

## Structure

- `contracts/` &mdash; Solidity contracts for each exercise
- `test/` &mdash; Hardhat/Chai test files validating the solutions
- `hardhat.config.js` &mdash; Hardhat configuration
- `package.json` &mdash; Project metadata and dependencies

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the tests**

   ```
   npm test
   ```

   This will compile the contracts and run all test cases in `test/`.

## Example: DummyToken

The provided `DummyToken` contract implements a simple `multiply` function, and is accompanied by test cases that check its correctness for positive numbers, negative numbers, zero, and larger numbers.

_Sample contract:_

```solidity
function multiply(int a, int b) pure public returns (int) {
  return a * b;
}
```

_Sample test:_

```js
it("Should multiply two positive numbers correctly", async function () {
  const result = await dummyToken.multiply(5, 10);
  expect(result).to.equal(50n);
});
```

## How to Use

- Clone/fork the repo.
- Browse the `contracts/` folder to find exercises.
- Implement your solution (or extend it).
- Run `npm test` to check correctness.

## Contribution

Want to add new Solidity exercises or improve tests? PRs are welcome! Please keep each new exercise self-contained in a single contract and test file.

Happy hacking and sharpening your Solidity skills!
