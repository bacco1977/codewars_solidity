# Codewars Solidity Practice

This repo contains a collection of Solidity smart contracts and corresponding JavaScript tests, designed as practical coding exercises to level up your smart contract development skills. Inspired by the "Codewars" philosophy: learn through hands-on, incremental challenges.

## Structure

- `contracts/` &mdash; Solidity contracts for each exercise
- `test/` &mdash; Hardhat/Chai test files validating the solutions
- `hardhat.config.js` &mdash; Hardhat configuration
- `package.json` &mdash; Project metadata and dependencies

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the tests**

   ```
   npm test
   ```

   This will compile the contracts and run all test cases in `test/`.

## Example: DummyToken

The provided `DummyToken` contract implements a simple `multiply` function, and is accompanied by test cases that check its correctness for positive numbers, negative numbers, zero, and larger numbers.

_Sample contract:_

```solidity
function multiply(int a, int b) pure public returns (int) {
  return a * b;
}
```

_Sample test:_

```js
it("Should multiply two positive numbers correctly", async function () {
  const result = await dummyToken.multiply(5, 10);
  expect(result).to.equal(50n);
});
```

## How to Use

- Clone/fork the repo.
- Browse the `contracts/` folder to find exercises.
- Implement your solution (or extend it).
- Run `npm test` to check correctness.

## Contribution

Want to add new Solidity exercises or improve tests? PRs are welcome! Please keep each new exercise self-contained in a single contract and test file.

## Table of Contents

1. [DummyToken](#dummytoken)
2. [CountByX (Multiples)](#countbyx-multiples)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run all tests

```bash
npm test
```
This will compile all smart contracts and run every test in the `test/` directory.

## Exercise List

### 1. DummyToken

**File:** `contracts/DummyToken.sol`  
**Test:** `test/DummyToken.test.js`

- Implements a classic multiplication function using signed integers.
- Tests verify multiplication for:
  - Two positive numbers
  - Positive and negative numbers
  - Zero multiplication
  - Large number multiplication

**Sample Solidity contract snippet:**
```solidity
function multiply(int a, int b) pure public returns (int) {
  return a * b;
}
```

**Sample JavaScript test:**
```js
it("Should multiply two positive numbers correctly", async function () {
  const result = await dummyToken.multiply(5, 10);
  expect(result).to.equal(50n);
});
```

---

### 2. CountByX (Multiples)

**File:** `contracts/countbyx.sol`  
**Test:** `test/countbyx.test.js`

- Provides a function to return the first `n` multiples of a number `x`.
- Useful for pattern generation and array manipulation exercises.
- Tests check for:
  - Correct array length
  - Correct multiples computation
  - Edge cases (e.g., `n=1`, large numbers)

**Sample Solidity contract snippet:**
```solidity
function countByX(uint x, uint n) public pure returns (uint[] memory) {
  uint[] memory result = new uint[](n);
  for (uint i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result[i] = x * (i + 1);
  }
  return result;
}
```

**Sample JavaScript test:**
```js
it("Should return the first 3 multiples of 5", async function () {
  const result = await multiplesContract.multiples(5, 3);
  expect(result.length).to.equal(3);
  expect(result[0]).to.equal(5n);
  expect(result[1]).to.equal(10n);
  expect(result[2]).to.equal(15n);
});
```

## How To Use

- Clone or fork this repository.
- Explore the `contracts/` folder for all available exercises.
- Implement or extend any contract.
- Run `npm test` to make sure your solution passes the test suite.
